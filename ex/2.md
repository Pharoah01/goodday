Generate OpenVPN client configuration flies and connect to server

Aim:
To generate OpenVPN client certificates and configuration files using Easy-RSA, and to establish a secure VPN connection between the client and the OpenVPN server.

Requirements:
Linux/Debian (or similar distributions) with OpenVPN server already set up
Internet access or local network connectivity between server and client
Sudo access (root/admin rights) on the Linux server
Windows system with OpenVPN GUI installed
OpenVPN and Easy-RSA must be installed on the Linux server
Client certificate and key must be generated using Easy-RSA
Client must be able to successfully connect to the VPN server using the OpenVPN GUI

Procedure:
Generate Client Certificate and Key:
Go to your Easy-RSA directory:
cd ~/openvpn-ca
Run:
./easyrsa gen-req client1 nopass





Now sign the request:
./easyrsa sign-req client client1

Copy Required Files:

We need to collect 4 files to build the .ovpn client config, Use this command to copy all into your home folder:

cp pki/issued/client1.crt pki/private/client1.key pki/ca.crt ta.key ~/

Create client1.ovpn Configuration File:
Now create the .ovpn file:
nano ~/client1.ovpn

Paste this template and replace placeholders:
client dev tun
proto udp
remote YOUR_SERVER_IP 1194 resolv-retry infinite
nobind persist-key persist-tun
remote-cert-tls server cipher AES-256-CBC key-direction 1
