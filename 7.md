1:
Aim: Configure UFW to allow only web traffic (HTTP/HTTPS) and deny all other connections.

Requirements:
1. A Linux system with ufw installed (e.g., Ubuntu, Debian)
2. Sudo privileges

Procedure:
1: Check current UFW status
----> sudo ufw status verbose
Displays currently active rules and status (active/inactive).

2: Disable UFW before resetting
----> sudo ufw disable
Stops the firewall temporarily to perform a clean reset.

3: Reset UFW to default settings
----> sudo ufw reset
Removes all existing rules, user-defined chains, and resets to factory defaults.
You’ll be asked for confirmation → type y.

4: Set default policies
----> sudo ufw default deny incoming
sudo ufw default allow outgoing

This ensures the system is secure before adding new rules.

5: Allow web service ports

Enable standard web ports:

----> sudo ufw allow 80/tcp    
sudo ufw allow 443/tcp     

6: Enable UFW
----> sudo ufw enable

7: Verify rules applied
----> sudo ufw status numbered

Output:
Status: active

To                         Action      From
--                         ------      ----
80/tcp                     ALLOW       Anywhere
443/tcp                    ALLOW       Anywhere
80/tcp (v6)                ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)
443/tcp (v6)               ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)

Result:
UFW was successfully reset to default settings, and new rules were applied to allow HTTP and HTTPS traffic.

Sub-ques:
(a) Command to check UFW status: sudo ufw status
(b) If the default incoming policy is set to "deny": 
All incoming connections are blocked by default unless specific rules allow them. 
Outgoing connections are unaffected. 
Ensures a secure default by only permitting explicitly allowed traffic.

2:Change SSH Port and Update Firewall

1: Edit SSH Configuration
Open the SSH server configuration file: sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config

Find the line: #Port 22

Change it to: Port 2222
Save and exit (Ctrl+O, Enter, Ctrl+X).

2: Update Firewall (UFW)
    1. Allow the new SSH port: sudo ufw allow 2222/tcp

    2. (Optional) Remove the old SSH port 22: sudo ufw delete allow 22/tcp

    3. Reload UFW to apply changes: sudo ufw reload

3: Restart SSH Service: sudo systemctl restart ssh

4: Test SSH Connection: ssh -p 2222 username@sercer_ip
-- Replace username and server_ip with your credentials.

Sub-ques:
(a) Changing the default SSH port is a security measure because it reduces automated attacks and port-scanning attempts that usually target the default port 22.

(b) You can test SSH connectivity after changing the port using:
    ssh -p <new_port> username@server_ip
    Example (ssh -p 2222 user@192.168.1.10)
